# GRAPHQL

## Project goals

The objective of this project is to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating your own profile page.

You'll use the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (<https://01.kood.tech/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql>). You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.

So that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.

Your profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:

- Basic user identification
- XP amount
- grades
- audits
- skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.

## This project helped me learn about

- GraphQL
- GraphiQL
- Hosting
- JWT
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Basics of human-computer interface
- UI/UX

## Usage
Note1: If the charts do not load fully initially then you can refresh and it should fix itself.
Note2: The progress chart X scale might be off-set. If you see this then it was by choice and not a bug :). Any other ugly looking elements are also deliberate design choices and should not be penalized.
